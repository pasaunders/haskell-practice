pg 91, question 4: seems it's not clear how to answer the question
    I didn't undersand that I needed to enter another changeMood
    entry. I'm also still having trouble understanding how = works
    in a function. I really wanted a way to test my guesses.

pg 94, first paragraph grammar issue: you say "constructors headed towards negative infinity, zero, and recursive
constructors headed towards positive infinity." the second "recursive constructors headed towards" seems redundant
and made it a bit harder to read.
